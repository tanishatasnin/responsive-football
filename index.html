<h2 class="copa">  Copa América-2021 </h2>
<p class="about-copa">The 2021 Copa América was the 47th edition of the
         Copa América, the international men's football 
         championship organised by South America's football 
         ruling body CONMEBOL. The tournament took place in Brazil f
         rom 13 June to 10 July 2021.[2] The tournament was
         originally scheduled to take place from 12 June
          to 12 July 2020 in Argentina and Colombia as the 2020 Copa 
          América. On 17 March 2020, CONMEBOL announced that due to the COVID-19 
          pandemic in South America, the tournament had been postponed for a year,
           in conjunction with UEFA's decision to also postpone UEFA 
           Euro 2020 to 
           2021.[3] This was the first time since 1991 where no guest 
           nation took part in the tournament.
           The match featured two rival teams: Argentina and 

           the tournament hosts, Brazil. Argentina won the match 
           1–0 to clinch their fifteenth Copa América title and first since 
           1993, giving captain Lionel Messi his first senior international 
           trophy sixteen years into his career.
            Argentina also equalled Uruguay's record of Copa América titles.

        On 20 May 2021, Colombia was removed as co-host amid ongoing protests against President Iván Duque Márquez, and Argentina was then removed on 30 May due to COVID-19 issues. The following day CONMEBOL confirmed Brazil as the new host of the tournament.[1]
        
        Hosts Brazil were the title holders, having won their ninth title in 2019, which they also hosted. Argentina won their fifteenth title after defeating Brazil 1–0 in the final, their first senior title since the 1993 edition of the same tournament.[4] They also equalled Uruguay's overall record of Copa América titles.[5]</p>
